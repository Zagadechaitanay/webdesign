# Push to GitHub Guide

## Steps to push your College Management System to GitHub:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "college-management-system")

### 2. Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
