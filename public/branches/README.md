6. `civil-engineering.png` - Civil Engineering branch theme
7. `automobile-engineering.png` - Automobile Engineering branch theme
8. `instrumentation-engineering.png` - Instrumentation Engineering branch theme
9. `aiml-engineering.png` - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML) branch theme
10. `mechatronics-engineering.png` - Mechatronics Engineering branch theme

## Image Specifications:

- **Recommended size**: 400x200px or 800x400px for branch cards
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **Aspect ratio**: 2:1 (width:height) works best for the card display
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal performance

## Usage:

These images will automatically appear in:
- Landing page branch cards (Available Engineering Branches section)
- User profile page (branch information section)

If an image is missing, the component will fallback to showing the icon instead.
